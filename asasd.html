    Here Is Some Informaton About One Of The Best Story:- 
    <b><u><i><pre>There were roses upon roses, all along the street—roses mingled with myrtle, all jumbled up like crazy in the road before me. The roofs themselves seemed to rock back and forth, and the church towers flew so many bright flags they blazed like bonfires. This happened exactly a year ago today.

        The sound of ringing bells was thick as a mist in the air, and the city's ancient walls shook with the crowd's happy shouts. If I'd said, "Kind people, all this noise is unpleasant—just give me the sun instead," they would have replied, "Sure! And what more can we do for you after that?"
        
        But alas, I was the one who reached for the sun, to try to bring it back for my adoring countrypeople. I did every heroic thing a person possibly could. And now, exactly a year later, you can see the fruits of all my labors.
        
        Now, there's nobody watching me from the roofs: just a few shaky old people looking out of their windows. That's because the best view today, everyone agrees, is right by the prison gates—or, even better, right at the foot of the gallows, I'd bet.
        
        I walk in the rain, and—though they really didn't need to—my captors tied my wrists behind my back, so tightly the rope cuts into me. And I get the feeling that my forehead is bleeding; anyone who feels like it can throw a rock at me in vengeance for the crimes I committed this year.
        
        I came into the city on these roads—and I'm leaving the same way! Right in the middle of triumphal parades like mine, people have fallen down dead. God might well ask me, "Since the world has given you this payment for your actions, what do you owe to me?" Now, God will be the one who <br>pays me—and that's a much safer proposition than trusting in other people.</pre></u></b></i>
